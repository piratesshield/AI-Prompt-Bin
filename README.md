**AI Prompt Bin** is a powerful Chrome Extension designed to capture, organize, and visualize your interactions with major AI tools like **ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, and Copilot**.

It runs entirely in your browser (offline-first) and provides a standalone dashboard for analytics.

NOTE : Prompts will display after 5-10 seconds in the dashboard. Because I have to capture the right aboslute URL once the response is loaded in the chat window.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. ⚡ Intelligent Auto-Capture
Automatically saves every prompt you send and every response you receive.
- **Pending Prompt Logic**: Waits for the AI response to start before saving the prompt, ensuring it captures the **exact permanent URL** of the chat session (fixing issues with `/new` temporary URLs).
- **Robust Capture**: Works even if the website clears the input box instantly (buffered recording).
- **Universal Support**: Works on ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot.
- **Privacy First**: All data is stored locally in your browser (`chrome.storage.local`).

### 2. 🧠 Memory Graph
A visual node-link diagram in the dashboard showing the relationship between:
- **AI Tools** (Which ones you use most)
- **Topics/Categories** (Code, Writing, General)
- **Individual Prompts** (Visualized as nodes)

### 3. 📊 Analytics Dashboard
Track your AI usage over time.
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: View activity by Day, Week, Month, or Year.
- **Tool Breakdown**: See exactly which AI tool you used on specific days.
- **Copy Button**: Quickly copy old prompts from the table to your clipboard.

### 4. 💡 Autocomplete Suggestions
As you type in any AI chat box, a non-intrusive popup suggests previous prompts you've used.
- **Paste (Cmd+V Style)**: New robust paste button that simulates a human paste action, working even on complex apps like Perplexity.
- **Cross-Platform**: Use your ChatGPT prompts inside Claude or Gemini instantly.
- **Copy & Link**: Copy text or jump to the original conversation URL.

### 5. 🔍 Organization
- **Search**: Filter history by keyword.
- **Filters**: Sort by AI Tool or Type (Prompt vs Response).
- **Export**: Download your entire history as JSON.
